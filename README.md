# DynamicCvGenerator

This project was created with the goal of rapidly updating the main skills of a CV, by providing a simple HTML view with some selectable tags, which add said skills to the CV and then it can be downloaded. Also serves as a way of showing off my CV to anyone interested.

## How to Use
The tool is very simple. It contains multiple tags that represent skills and can be selected by clicking on them. This tags will then be added to the previewed CV so you can visualize how it will look. 

There is also a way to set the language of the CV, by interacting with 2 checkboxes for German and English language.

Once the preferred skills and languages are set the DownloadPDF button can be clicked and it will convert the previewed HTMl into a pdf, **Please keep in mind that the resulting pdf will not look exactly like the preview due to limitations on converting styled html to a pdf format**
