# DynamicCvGenerator

This project was created with the goal of rapidly updating the main skills of a CV, by providing a simple HTML view with some selectable tags, which add said skills to the CV and then it can be downloaded. Also serves as a way of showing off my CV to anyone interested (please hire me im desperate)
